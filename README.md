Damage Log is a FoundryVTT module that monitiors for changes to characters' health, and displays those changes in a separate chatlog tab (currently only viewable by the GM).  Changes can be easily be undone, or re-applied using the chat card's right-click menu.

Damage Log is also compatible with the [Tabbed Chatlog](https://github.com/cswendrowski/FoundryVTT-Tabbed-Chatlog) module, and will add an extra tab on to the end of Tabbed Chatlog's tabs.
